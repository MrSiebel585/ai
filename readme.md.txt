**WhiteRabbitNeo** is an open-source series of large language models specifically fine-tuned to empower cybersecurity professionals in both offensive ("red team") and defensive ("blue team") operations. Designed to be your intelligent cybersecurity copilot, WhiteRabbitNeo assists with a wide range of tasks, from vulnerability analysis and exploit generation to threat intelligence research and security automation.

**Key Features:**

* **Dual-Use Capability:** Engineered for both offensive and defensive security workflows.
* **"Uncensored" for Security Tasks:** Allows for realistic simulation of attacker techniques and comprehensive vulnerability analysis without unnecessary restrictions.
* **Open Source:** Fosters community collaboration, transparency, and accessibility.
* **Transformer Architecture:** Built upon state-of-the-art transformer models for powerful text generation and understanding.
* **Fine-Tuned for Cybersecurity:** Trained on extensive datasets of security-related information, including vulnerability databases, threat intelligence reports, code examples, and security documentation.
* **Extensible and Integrable:** Designed to work alongside existing security tools and can be integrated into various development and security platforms.

## Example Uses

WhiteRabbitNeo can be leveraged for a multitude of cybersecurity tasks. Here are a few examples:

**Offensive Security (Red Team):**

* **Vulnerability Analysis Assistance:**
    * Generating potential exploit strategies based on vulnerability descriptions (e.g., CVE details).
    * Suggesting relevant attack vectors and techniques for specific vulnerabilities.
    * Crafting initial drafts of exploit code in various programming languages (Python, Ruby, etc.).
* **Payload Generation:**
    * Assisting in the creation of basic payloads for penetration testing tools like Metasploit (e.g., reverse shells).
    * Generating obfuscated code snippets to evade basic detection mechanisms.
* **Social Engineering Support:**
    * Drafting convincing phishing email templates or social media messages.
    * Generating realistic pretext scenarios for social engineering engagements.
* **Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:**
    * Formulating search queries for open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering.
    * Summarizing information from multiple sources related to a target.

**Defensive Security (Blue Team):**

* **Secure Code Analysis:**
    * Identifying potential security vulnerabilities in code snippets (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    * Suggesting secure coding practices and remediation strategies.
    * Generating code examples demonstrating secure alternatives.
* **Threat Intelligence Research:**
    * Summarizing threat reports and extracting key indicators of compromise (IOCs).
    * Generating queries for threat intelligence platforms.
    * Identifying potential attack patterns based on threat actor profiles.
* **Security Automation:**
    * Generating basic scripts for automating security tasks (e.g., log analysis, vulnerability scanning).
    * Assisting in the creation of rules for Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).
* **Security Documentation and Training:**
    * Generating explanations of security concepts and vulnerabilities.
    * Creating basic training materials and examples.

## Scripts and Code Examples

This section provides examples of how you might interact with a WhiteRabbitNeo model. Please note that the exact implementation will depend on how you are accessing and using the model (e.g., through an API, a local deployment, or a specific library).

**Prerequisites:**

* Access to a running WhiteRabbitNeo model (local or remote).
* Necessary libraries for interacting with the model (e.g., `requests` for API calls, specific model interaction libraries).

**Example 1: Vulnerability Analysis (Red Team)**

Let's say you have information about CVE-2023-XXXX, a remote code execution vulnerability in a web server. You can ask WhiteRabbitNeo for potential exploit strategies.

```python
# Python example using a hypothetical API client
import whiterabbitneo_client

client = whiterabbitneo_client.Client(api_url="YOUR_WHITERRABBITNEO_API_URL")

vulnerability_description = "CVE-2023-XXXX: Remote code execution vulnerability in vulnerable web server versions prior to X. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to execute arbitrary code on the server."

prompt = f"Based on the following vulnerability description: '{vulnerability_description}', suggest potential exploit strategies and techniques."

response = client.generate_text(prompt)
print(response)
